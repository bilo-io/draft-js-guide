# Draft.js Guide
by Bilo Lwabona

## Overview

[Draft.js](https://draftjs.org/) is a rich text editor that is very powerful, and quite extensible. Unfortunately, there is not as much documentation out there as you would like.

As such, I created this guide so that others don't have to go through the pain staking process of digging through a bunch of code all over, in order to get to this point.

## Contents

The lessons are all in this one [Github repo](https://github.com/bilo-io/draft-js-guide), each under it's own branch, named after the lesson. Furthermore, the things covered in the respective lesson have also been implemented, and are present in the source of the same branch.
