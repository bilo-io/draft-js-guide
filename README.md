# Draft.js Guide
by Bilo Lwabona

## Overview

[Draft.js](https://draftjs.org/) is a rich text editor that is very powerful, and quite extensible. Unfortunately, there is not as much documentation out there as you would like.

As such, I created this guide so that others don't have to go through the pain staking process of digging through a bunch of code all over, in order to get to this point.

## Guide Structure

The lessons are all in this one [Github repo](https://github.com/bilo-io/draft-js-guide), each in it's own page (under `src/app/pages/`) on the `master` branch. Furthermore, the things covered in the respective lesson have also been implemented, and are present in the source of the same branch.
