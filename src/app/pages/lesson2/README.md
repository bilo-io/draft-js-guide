# Draft.js Guide
by Bilo Lwabona

[Draft.js](https://draftjs.org/) is a rich text editor that is very powerful, and quite extensible. Unfortunately, there is not as much documentation out there as you would like.

## Lessons

- [Lesson 1: Intro to Draft.js](https://github.com/bilo-io/draft-js-guide/tree/master/src/app/pages/lesson1)
- Lesson 2: Draft.js API( current )
- [Lesson 3: Draft.js Plugins](hhttps://github.com/bilo-io/draft-js-guide/tree/master/src/app/pages/lesson3)
- [Lesson 4: Draft.js Custom Plugins](https://github.com/bilo-io/draft-js-guide/tree/master/src/app/pages/lesson4)

## Lesson 2

In the last lesson we created a basic editor. Without doing much. Here, we go over the [Draft.js API](https://draftjs.org/docs/overview.html#content), which allows you to access and modify various parts of the editor's State.

There are many things to cover, but I think some essential things to know about, are:

 - editorState
 - contentState
 - selectionState
 - entities
 - decorators
